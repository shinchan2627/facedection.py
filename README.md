**Project Title**: Real-time Face Detection with OpenCV

**Description**:

The "Real-time Face Detection with OpenCV" project is a Python application that leverages the power of OpenCV, a popular computer vision library, to detect and highlight human faces in real-time video streams. This project showcases the capability of OpenCV to process video data and identify faces within the captured frames.

**Key Features**:

1. **Face Detection**: The project utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade Classifier model ("haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml") to detect faces within the video feed.

2. **Real-time Processing**: The code is designed to continuously capture video frames from the default webcam (index 0) and process them for face detection in real-time.

3. **Visual Feedback**: Detected faces are outlined with green rectangles, providing a visual indication of where the faces are located in the video.

4. **User Interaction**: The application allows the user to exit the real-time face detection loop by pressing the 'Esc' key (key code 27).

**Usage**:

To use this application, simply run the Python script. It will open a window titled "kakamutta" displaying the live video feed with detected faces outlined in green rectangles. To exit the program, press the 'Esc' key.

**Significance**:

Real-time face detection has a wide range of applications, from security and surveillance to user experience enhancements in video conferencing and photography. This project serves as a practical example of how to implement a real-time face detection system using OpenCV, making it a valuable resource for developers and enthusiasts interested in computer vision and facial recognition technologies.
